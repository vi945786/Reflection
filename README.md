# Reflection

### ... because Java Reflection kind of sucks

### ... and this library makes it suck a little less.

supports java 9 to 21

Including:

1. Helper methods to get Fields, Methods and Constructors.

2. Change values of fields, invoke methods and create new instances by invoking constructors.

3. Support for accessing "Inaccessible" objects which would result in an InaccessibleObjectException when accessing with regular reflection.
